        <img src="oldest/b.jpg">
        <p>
          The Rialto Bridge (Italian: Ponte di Rialto; Venetian: Ponte de Rialto) is the oldest of the four bridges spanning the Grand Canal
          in Venice, Italy. Connecting the sestieri (districts) of San Marco and San Polo, it has been rebuilt several times since its first
          construction as a pontoon bridge in 1173,
          and is now a significant tourist attraction in the city.[3]

              <p class="text-right">
                The Pons Fabricius (Italian: Ponte Fabricio, "Fabrician Bridge") or Ponte dei Quattro Capi,
                is the oldest Roman bridge in Rome, Italy, still existing in its original state.[1] Built in 62 BC, 
                it spans half of the Tiber River, from the Campus Martius on the east side to Tiber Island in the middle
                (the Pons Cestius is west of the island). Quattro Capi ("four heads") refers to the two marble pillars
                of the two-faced Janus herms on the parapet, 
                which were moved here from the nearby Church of St Gregory (Monte Savello) in the 14th century.[2]

              <p>
                The Kapellbrücke (literally, Chapel Bridge) is a covered wooden footbridge spanning the river Reuss diagonally in the city of Lucerne 
                in central Switzerland. Named after the nearby St. Peter's Chapel,[1] the bridge is unique in containing a number of interior paintings
                dating back to the 17th century, although many of them were destroyed along with a larger part of the centuries-old bridge in a 1993 fire.
                Subsequently restored, the Kapellbrücke is the oldest wooden covered bridge in Europe,[2][3] as well as the world's oldest surviving truss bridge.
                [4] It serves as the city's symbol and as one of Switzerland's main tourist attractions.

            <h1>FRANKFORD AVENUE BRIDGE</h1>
            <img src="oldest/m.jpg">
            <p>
              The Frankford Avenue Bridge, also known as the Pennypack Creek Bridge, the Pennypack Bridge, the Holmesburg Bridge, and the King's 
              Highway Bridge, erected in 1697 in the Holmesburg section of Northeast Philadelphia, in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania, is the oldest
              surviving roadway bridge in the United States. The three-span, 73-foot-long (22 m)
              twin stone arch bridge carries Frankford Avenue (U.S. Route 13), just north of Solly Avenue, over Pennypack Creek in Pennypack Park.[2]
              The bridge was designated a National Historic Civil
              Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers in 1970. 
              It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.

            <h1>ARKADIKO BRIDGE</h1>
            <img src="oldest/old2.jpg">
            <p>
              The Arkadiko Bridge or Kazarma Bridge is a Mycenaean bridge near the modern road from Tiryns to Epidauros on the Peloponnese, Greece. Dating
              to the Greek Bronze Age, it is one of the oldest arch bridges still in existence and use today and the oldest preserved bridge in Europe.
              The corbel arch bridge belonged in Mycenaean times to a highway between the two cities, which formed part of a wider military
              road network. It has a culvert span of ca. 1 m and is made in the typical Mycenaean manner of Cyclopean stones. 
              The structure is 22 metres (72 ft) long, 5.60 metres (18.4 ft) wide at the base and 4 metres (13 ft) high.
              The width of the roadway atop is about 2.50 metres (8 ft 2 in). The sophisticated layout of the bridge and the road
              indicate that they were specifically constructed for use by chariots.
              [1] Built in the late Late Helladic III (ca. 1300–1190 BC), the bridge is still used by the local populace.[2]

            <h1>BRIDGE NEAR LIMRIYA</h1>
            <img src="oldest/old3.jpg">
            <p>
              The Bridge near Limyra (in Turkish: Kırkgöz Kemeri, "Bridge of the Forty Arches") is a late Roman bridge in Lycia,
              in modern south-west Turkey, and one of the oldest segmented arch bridges in the world. Located near the ancient city
              of Limyra, it is the largest civil engineering structure of antiquity in the region, spanning the Alakır Çayı river 
              over a length of 360 m (1,181.1 ft) on 26 segmental arches. These arches, with a span-to-rise ratio of 5.3:1,
              give the bridge an unusually flat profile, and were unsurpassed as an architectural achievement until the late
              Middle Ages. Today, the structure is largely buried by river sediments and surrounded by greenhouses.
              Despite its unique features, the bridge remains relatively unknown,
              and only in the 1970s did researchers from the Istanbul branch of the German Archaeological Institute carry out field 
              examinations on the site.

            <p>
              The Pergamon Bridge is a Roman substruction bridge over the Selinus river (modern Bergama Çayı) in the ancient city of Pergamon 
              (today Bergama), modern-day Turkey. The 196 m (643 ft) wide structure, the largest of its kind in antiquity,[1]
              was designed during Hadrian's reign (AD 117–138) in order to form a passageway underneath a large court in front of the monumental
              "Red Basilica" temple complex. The two intact tubes, which consist of supporting walls covered with barrel vaults, 
              still serve their purpose to this day.

            <h1>LUOYANG BRIDGE</h1>
            <img src="oldest/old5.jpg">
            <p>
              The Luoyang Bridge, also known as Wan'an Bridge, is located in Quanzhou, Fujian province, China. The stone bay bridge is situated at the
              mouth of Luoyang River. Being the first stone bay bridge in China, it enjoys the reputation of " one of the four ancient bridges of China".[1]
              The project started from the fifth year (1053) of Huangyou's ruling period in the Northern Song Dynasty. 
              Cai xiang, the chief of Quanzhou prefercture in the 3rd year (1058) of Jiayou's reign, took over the task of constructing the bridge, 
              who had overcome several difficulties concerning bridge deck pavement and bridge pier by applying a raft foundation 
              and raising oysters in the river to solid the base. In the fourth year (1059) of Jiayou's reign,
              the construction of Luoyang bridge was completed and Caixiang wrote "The Wan'an bridge" for it.
              The bridge had been reconstructed and repaired in the later dynasties.
              In the Southern Song dynasty, pagodas and fengshui pagodas were built outside the guardrail of the bridge.

            <p>
              The Karamagara Bridge (Turkish: Karamağara Köprüsü, "Bridge of the Black Cave") is a Byzantine or late Roman bridge
              in the ancient region of Cappadocia in eastern Turkey, and possibly the earliest known pointed arch bridge.[1]
              The bridge, along with much of the Arapgir Çayı valley, has been submerged since the completion of the Keban Dam in 1975,
              as a result of which the water level in the Euphrates valley and some of its upstream tributaries dramatically rose.[2]

            <h1>BAND E KAISAR BRIDGE</h1>
            <img src="oldest/old7.jpg">
            <p>
              The Band-e Kaisar (Persian: بند قیصر, "Caesar's dam"‎), Pol-e Kaisar ("Caesar's bridge"), Bridge of Valerian or Shadirwan was an ancient
              arch bridge in Shushtar, Iran, and the first in the country to combine it with a dam.[1] Built by the Sassanids, using Roman prisoners 
              of war as workforce, in the 3rd century AD on Sassanid order,[2] it was also the most eastern example of Roman bridge design and Roman
              dam, lying deep in Persian territory.[3]
              Its dual-purpose design exerted a profound influence on Iranian civil engineering and was instrumental in developing Sassanid water
              management techniques.[4]
              The approximately 500 m long overflow dam over the Karun, Iran's most effluent river, was the core structure of the Shushtar Historical 
              Hydraulic System (سازه‌های آبی شوشتر) from which the city derived its agricultural productivity,[5] and which has been designated by the
              UNESCO as Iran's 10th World Heritage Site in 2009.[6] The arched superstructure carried across the important road between Pasargadae and 
              the Sassanid capital Ctesiphon.[7] Many times repaired in the Islamic period,[8] the dam bridge remained in use until the late 19th century.

              The Severan Bridge (also known as Chabinas Bridge or Cendere Bridge or Septimius Severus Bridge; Turkish: Cendere Köprüsü)
              is a late Roman bridge located near the ancient city of Arsameia (today Eskikale), 55 km (34 mi) north east of Adıyaman in
              southeastern Turkey. It spans the Cendere Çayı (Chabinas Creek), a tributary of Kâhta Creek, on provincial road 02-03 from
              Kâhta to Sincik in Adıyaman Province. This bridge was described and pictured in 1883 by archeologists Osman Hamdi Bey and
              Osgan Efendi.[2] It is also has a photo and
              description in David George Hogarth's Wandering Scholar In The Levant, publ 1896, Chapter 4, a description of an 1894 visit (preface).
